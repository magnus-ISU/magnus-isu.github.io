I am a software engineering student at Iowa State University.

I enjoy reading books; mostly science fiction and fantasy, though I am going through some books on economics recently as well.

I speak Portuguese and am learning Japanese, and to help me with this I want to create a libre replacement for LingQ, but more modern than LWT or FLTR (good projects, but showing their age).

I first became exposed in programming creating GameMaker games when I was around 11 or 12. I enjoyed it, but I didn't fully understand how the programs I was making worked. I am now learning a variety of programming topics, always starting from the simplest working concepts so that I can confidently explain every step of the process to myself and anyone who happens to run my code.

## Interests

I am currently working with the following technologies:

 - Javascript for Webextensions
 - Svelte (this page is written in it)
 - Rust
 - Godot

I am also curious to learn more about

 - Zig
 - Kotlin
 - Redox OS
 - Flatpak
 - QML and GTK
 - Vulkan

## Ideology

Life before Death  
Strength before Weakness  
Journey before Destination  
Tabs before Spaces
