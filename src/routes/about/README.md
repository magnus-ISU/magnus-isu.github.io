I am a software engineering student at Iowa State University.

I first became exposed in programming creating GameMaker games when I was around 11 or 12. I enjoyed it, but I didn't fully understand how the programs I was making worked. I am now learning a variety of programming topics, always starting from the simplest working concepts so that I can confidently explain every step of the process to myself and anyone who happens to run my code.

I enjoy reading science fiction and fantasy, though I am going through some books on economics recently as well.

## Work

My most important projects are these 2 repositories:

 - [Video Speed Controller](https://github.com/magnus-ISU/videospeed): A firefox extension to control the speed of HTML5 video and audio, which I decided to fork after the upstream didn't add features or fixes fast enough. I have refactored the code a lot to make it comfier and more useful.
 - [doasedit](https://gitlab.com/magnustesshu/doasedit): A shell script that gives `doas` most of the power of `sudoedit` and `visudo` with a lot more simplicity. I maintain the AUR package for this, too.

Additionally, I've started the following projects, and think they could move up to the above list with more development or effort:

 - [Youtube Empowered](https://github.com/magnus-ISU/youtube-empowered): A firefox extension which makes youtube better.
 - [Librewolf Prefpane](https://github.com/magnus-ISU/temp_librewolf_prefpane): The Librewolf Browser, but with an actual settings page because the standard one is broken

I've also got some projects I plan to eventually make:

 - qoi-wuffs: I think the [Quite Okay Image](https://github.com/phoboslab/qoi) format is a very interesting project, and think that creating a `wuffs` encoder/decoder could be a fun way to learn that language.
 - magish: Miraculous Amazing Graphical Incomplete Shell, a GUI program which would allow you to run shell commands without a keyboard. Mostly an idea, would be a fun way to learn Qt or Gtk.
 - CorrodedReader: I speak Portuguese and am learning Japanese, and while the [Foreign Language Text Reader](https://github.com/magnus-ISU/foreign-language-text-reader) is a useful tool, it is a Java Swing GUI straight out of 2010. I would like to make something closer to LingQ, but free.
 - Select Default Application: I want to substantially improve [this tool](https://github.com/magnus-ISU/selectdefaultapplication), so it can help users understand all the default applications on their computers rather than being a semi-useful tool without search functionality.

I've contributed to the following projects as well:

 - [rust-lolcat-git](https://github.com/ur0/lolcat): Made it handle escape sequences properly. Became a maintainer.
 - [CoreKeyboard](https://gitlab.com/cubocore/coreapps/corekeyboard): Autostart in tray, add interpreting command-line options, properly distinguish the target platform and use `enum`s rather than magic integers to do so.
 - [antidot](https://github.com/doron-cohen/antidot/pull/172): Antidot generates some scripts to be run by different shells from a configuration file. I made it generate these on-the-fly rather than having every shell script be generated and written to disk every time you ran the program. I also added support to a new shell, and improved some command-line information it gives you.
 - [πmenu](https://github.com/phillbush/pmenu): Added a command-line option which makes it much easier to configure πmenu for its intended purpose.
 - [Sweet Theme](https://github.com/EliverLara/Sweet): Fixed theme parsing errors from GTK
 - [Shitpost](https://github.com/magnus-ISU/shitpost): A fun little command-line script to make memes. Improved the design and interface, and became the maintainer.
 - [Runtime Terror bot](https://github.com/magnus-ISU/RT-bot): A discord bot for a server I'm in. Added Poll functionality, so we could remove a different (inferior) bot we were using for that purpose.
 - [SysMonTask](https://github.com/magnus-ISU/SysMonTask): Removed some calls to `popen` which could be implemented easily in python code; fixed the way it counted open threads on a system; removed some dead code.
 - [Foreign Language Text Reader](https://github.com/magnus-ISU/foreign-language-text-reader): Added build information and scripts, and conforms to the XDG Base Directory specification.

## Interests

I am always curious to learn as much as I can about programming and computers, but these are the technologies that I am most interested in right now:

 - Javascript for Webextensions
 - Svelte (my website uses it!)
 - Rust
 - Godot
 - Vulkan
 - QML and GTK
 - Kotlin
 - Flatpak
 - Redox OS
 - Zig
 - Wuffs

## Ideology

Life before Death  
Strength before Weakness  
Journey before Destination  
Tabs before Spaces
