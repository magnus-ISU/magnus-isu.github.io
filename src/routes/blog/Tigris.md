## Rules

- To start, place the treasure-temples on the indicated map tiles.
- Shuffle all tiles into the bag, then each player takes 6 alongside their dynasty's leaders.

## Each Player's Turn

On your turn, you may perform up to two actions in any order of the following four options:

- Discard up to 6 tiles, then draw to 6.
- Play one of your two Catastrophes on an empty space or over a tile (not on treasures, buildings, or leaders).
  If the Catastrophe removes the last Temple in the 4 adjacent tiles to a leader, then the leader is withdrawn.
- Place/move a leader (or withdraw a leader to your hand)
  Land is a non-river empty space. You can only place/move your leader to land adjacent to a temple.
  A kingdom is a group of tiles adjacent with a leader. You cannot connect two kingdoms.
  If your another player (the ruler) has a leader of the same color in the kingdom, you incite a Revolt:
  1. You discard any number of temples from your hand; then the ruler does.
  2. Your influence is the number of temples adjacent to your leader plus the temples you discarded.
  3. You win if you have more influence than the ruler.
  4. Whoever won the Revolt gets one red point, and the loser withdraws their leader.
- Place one of your tiles; farms on rivers, tiles on land.
  If there is no War, the leader controlling that color in the kingdom gets a point.
  If the colored leader is in the kingdom, they control it. Otherwise, if the (black) King is in the kingdom, the King controls it.
  You cannot unite more than two kingdoms.
  If you unite two kingdoms and any color has more than one leader in the kingdom, War breaks out.
  1. Place the tile upside down.
  2. Until War is over, choose one such color to do battle!
  3. If you are not involved, choose the attacker. Otherwise you are.
  4. One's supporters are same-colored tiles and leaders in one's leader's kingdom.
  5. The attacker discards any number of tiles of the contested leader's color, gaining that many supporters; then the defender does.
  6. The attacker wins if they have more supporters than the defender.
  7. The winner removes the loser's leader and supporters from the board, each piece removed gives a point of the leader's color.

## End of an action

Now, if you have created certain structures all of the same color of tiles, you may build and receive building rewards.

- If there is a 2x2, you may place a Monument of the same color on the tiles.
  At the end of a player's turn, each of their leaders in the Monuments' kingdom gets a point if they control the Monument's color(s).
- (Optional) If there are 5 tiles in a cross, you may place the Wonder on the tiles.
  When the king ends his turn in the Wondrous kingdom, his player chooses any point to gain.
- (Optional) If there is a 3x1 or longer, you may place a Landmark on one of the tiles.
  When a tile of the Landmark's color is placed in its kingdom, the leader gets double points.
  Landmarks count as supporters and temples but are not removed in wars.

The tiles under a Monument or Wonder do not count for wars and revolts.
If a Monument or Wonder removes all of a leader's adjacent temples, the leader is withdrawn.

## End of a turn

At the end of your turn, all players draw back to six tiles.
The game ends when a player cannot draw because there are no more tiles, or at the end of a turn if fewer than 3 treasures are on the board.

- All players reveal their victory points, adding any point for a treasure.
- The player with the most points in their weakest color wins; ties are broken by the next weakest color.

## Original Rule Changes

- On the advanced board, remove 4 temples from the main game.
- In a war, the attacker is always chosen as the player who would go soonest.
