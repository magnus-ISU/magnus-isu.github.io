I enjoyed it, but I didn’t fully understand how the programs I was making worked. I am now learning a variety of programming topics, always starting from the simplest working concepts so that I can confidently explain every step of the process to myself and anyone who happens to run my code.</p> <p>I enjoy reading science fiction and fantasy, though I am going through some books on economics recently as well.</p> <h2 id="work"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#work"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Work</h2> <p>My most important projects are these 2 repositories:</p> <ul><li><a href="https://github.com/magnus-ISU/videospeed" rel="nofollow">Video Speed Controller</a>: A firefox extension to control the speed of HTML5 video and audio, which I decided to fork after the upstream didn’t add features or fixes fast enough. I have refactored the code a lot to make it comfier and more useful.</li> <li><a href="https://gitlab.com/magnustesshu/doasedit" rel="nofollow">doasedit</a>: A shell script that gives <code>doas</code> most of the power of <code>sudoedit</code> and <code>visudo</code> with a lot more simplicity. I maintain the AUR package for this, too.</li></ul> <p>Additionally, I’ve started the following projects, and think they could move up to the above list with more development or effort:</p> <ul><li><a href="https://github.com/magnus-ISU/youtube-empowered" rel="nofollow">Youtube Empowered</a>: A firefox extension which makes youtube better.</li> <li><a href="https://github.com/magnus-ISU/temp_librewolf_prefpane" rel="nofollow">Librewolf Prefpane</a>: The Librewolf Browser, but with an actual settings page because the standard one is broken</li></ul> <p>I’ve also got some projects I plan to eventually make:</p> <ul><li>qoi-wuffs: I think the <a href="https://github.com/phoboslab/qoi" rel="nofollow">Quite Okay Image</a> format is a very interesting project, and think that creating a <code>wuffs</code> encoder/decoder could be a fun way to learn that language.</li> <li>magish: Miraculous Amazing Graphical Incomplete Shell, a GUI program which would allow you to run shell commands without a keyboard. Mostly an idea, would be a fun way to learn Qt or Gtk.</li> <li>CorrodedReader: I speak Portuguese and am learning Japanese, and while the <a href="https://github.com/magnus-ISU/foreign-language-text-reader" rel="nofollow">Foreign Language Text Reader</a> is a useful tool, it is a Java Swing GUI straight out of 2010. I would like to make something closer to LingQ, but free.</li></ul> <p>I’ve contributed to the following projects as well:</p> <ul><li><a href="https://github.com/ur0/lolcat" rel="nofollow">rust-lolcat-git</a>: Made it handle escape sequences properly. Became a maintainer.</li> <li><a href="https://github.com/magnus-ISU/selectdefaultapplication" rel="nofollow">Select Default Application</a>: I have substantially improved this utility, adding search, more rich information about the default applications on their system, better navigation and some bugfixes.</li> <li><a href="https://gitlab.com/cubocore/coreapps/corekeyboard" rel="nofollow">CoreKeyboard</a>: Autostart in tray, add interpreting command-line options, properly distinguish the target platform and use <code>enum</code>s rather than magic integers to do so.</li> <li><a href="https://github.com/doron-cohen/antidot/pull/172" rel="nofollow">antidot</a>: Antidot generates some scripts to be run by different shells from a configuration file. I made it generate these on-the-fly rather than having every shell script be generated and written to disk every time you ran the program. I also added support to a new shell, and improved some command-line information it gives you.</li> <li><a href="https://github.com/phillbush/pmenu" rel="nofollow">πmenu</a>: Added a command-line option which makes it much easier to configure πmenu for its intended purpose.</li> <li><a href="https://github.com/EliverLara/Sweet" rel="nofollow">Sweet Theme</a>: Fixed theme parsing errors from GTK</li> <li><a href="https://github.com/magnus-ISU/anki-touch" rel="nofollow">Anki-touch</a>: Reimplemented an old Anki extension from 8 years ago in the new 2.1 addon API</li> <li><a href="https://github.com/magnus-ISU/shitpost" rel="nofollow">Shitpost</a>: A fun little command-line script to make memes. Improved the design and interface, and became the maintainer.</li> <li><a href="https://github.com/magnus-ISU/RT-bot" rel="nofollow">Runtime Terror bot</a>: A discord bot for a server I’m in. Added Poll functionality, so we could remove a different (inferior) bot we were using for that purpose.</li> <li><a href="https://github.com/magnus-ISU/SysMonTask" rel="nofollow">SysMonTask</a>: Removed some calls to <code>popen</code> which could be implemented easily in python code; fixed the way it counted open threads on a system; removed some dead code.</li> <li><a href="https://github.com/magnus-ISU/foreign-language-text-reader" rel="nofollow">Foreign Language Text Reader</a>: Added build information and scripts, and conforms to the XDG Base Directory specification.</li></ul> <h2 id="interests"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#interests"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Interests</h2> <p>I am always curious to learn as much as I can about programming and computers, but these are the technologies that I am most interested in right now:</p> <ul><li>Javascript for Webextensions</li> <li>Svelte (my website uses it!)</li> <li>Rust</li> <li>Godot</li> <li>Vulkan</li> <li>QML and GTK</li> <li>Kotlin</li> <li>Flatpak</li> <li>Redox OS</li> <li>Zig</li> <li>Wuffs</li></ul> <h2 id="ideology"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#ideology"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Ideology</h2> <p>Life before Death<br> Strength before Weakness<br> Journey before Destination<br> Tabs before Spaces</p> <h2 id="contact"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#contact"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Contact</h2> <ul><li>Matrix: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@magnustesshu:matrix.org" rel="nofollow">@magnustesshu:matrix.org</a></li> <li>Discord: eldrichart#4161</li> <li>Email: <a href="mailto:magnus@iastate.edu">magnus@iastate.edu</a></li></ul>',1);function m(e){var o=n();t(36),a(e,o)}export{m as default,h as metadata};
