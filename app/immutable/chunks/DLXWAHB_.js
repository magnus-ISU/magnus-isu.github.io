If the Catastrophe removes the last Temple in the 4 adjacent tiles to a leader, then the leader is withdrawn.</li> <li>Place/move a leader (or withdraw a leader to your hand).
You can only place/move your leader to an empty non-river space adjacent to a temple.
A kingdom is a group of tiles adjacent with a leader. You cannot connect two kingdoms.
If your another player (the ruler) has a leader of the same color in the kingdom, you incite a Revolt: <ol><li>You discard any number of temples from your hand; then the ruler does.</li> <li>Your influence is the number of temples adjacent to your leader plus the temples you discarded.</li> <li>You win if you have more influence than the ruler.</li> <li>Whoever won the Revolt gets one red point, and the loser withdraws their leader.</li></ol></li> <li>Place one of your tiles; farms on rivers, tiles on other spaces.
If two kingdoms are not connected, the leader controlling that color in the kingdom gets a point.
If the colored leader is in the kingdom, they control it. Otherwise, if the (black) King is in the kingdom, the King controls it.
You cannot unite more than two kingdoms.
If you unite two kingdoms and any color has more than one leader in the kingdom, War breaks out. <ol><li>Place the tile upside down until the War is over.</li> <li>Until War is over, choose one such color to do battle!</li> <li>If you are involved, you are the attacker.
